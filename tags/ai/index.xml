&lt;p>&lt;strong>Hello, world.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you've ever typed &amp;quot;how to prepare for a Machine Learning Engineer interview&amp;quot; into a search bar, you know the feeling. It's like standing at the base of a mountain covered in fog. The path isn't clear, and the peak seems impossibly far away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The list of required skills is daunting. Unlike interviews for SDE, the industry has not standardized the interview process for MLE roles. In fact, they don’t even agree on what an MLE should be. You need to be a solid software engineer, fluent in algorithms and data structures. You need to be a practical scientist, with a deep intuition for model mechanics, from linear regression to transformers. And on top of all that, you need to be an architect, capable of designing large-scale, distributed systems that can serve models to millions of users.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
