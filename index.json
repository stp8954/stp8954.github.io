It's like standing at the base of a mountain covered in fog. The path isn't clear, and the peak seems impossibly far away.\nThe list of required skills is daunting. Unlike interviews for SDE, the industry has not standardized the interview process for MLE roles. In fact, they don’t even agree on what an MLE should be. You need to be a solid software engineer, fluent in algorithms and data structures. You need to be a practical scientist, with a deep intuition for model mechanics, from linear regression to transformers. And on top of all that, you need to be an architect, capable of designing large-scale, distributed systems that can serve models to millions of users.\nIt’s a lot. And frankly, a scattered approach of randomly doing LeetCode problems and taking courses won't cut it.\nI started my interview prep journey early this year and went through multiple interview rounds at large and medium sized companies (Lyft, Netflix, Meta, Chewy, Expedia, Atlassian). Converted 2 and made it to the last round of the rest. It was not easy to switch from an SDE to an MLE role and learned a lot during that phase. I plan to take another shot at some of those again later in the year and I’ve decided to do it in the open. I feel that the best way to learn is to teach, and the best way to stay accountable is to have a public plan. This blog is that plan. My goal is to create a structured, comprehensive resource based on the interviews I went through so far so I can follow it in the future, and that I hope can serve as a guide for anyone else on the same path.\nThe Game Plan I dont have the details figured out yet, but am thinking on publishing in multiple tracks.\nTrack 1: The Practice Loop (Weekly)This is our bread and butter. Every week, we'll tackle the fundamentals with a \u0026quot;workout\u0026quot; consisting of:\nCoding Problems: 2-3 LeetCode-style problems (a mix of mediums and hards) focusing on patterns crucial for tech interviews. This will be mostly resources to some really good explanations on YouTube and other blogs\nML Concepts (Q\u0026amp;A): A few \u0026quot;flashcard-style\u0026quot; questions and answers covering core ML theory. Think: \u0026quot;Explain the bias-variance tradeoff,\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;What is label leakage and how do you prevent it?\u0026quot;\nML Coding Challenge: A hands-on problem like \u0026quot;Implement logistic regression from scratch using NumPy\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;Code a custom K-Fold cross-validator.\u0026quot;\nTrack 2: From Paper to Practice (Weekly)Top engineers stay current. In this track, we'll dissect one influential paper a week, focusing on foundational work in NLP, Ranking, or Recommender Systems. We won't just summarize it; we'll follow a rigorous \u0026quot;three-pass\u0026quot; methodology to understand its core contribution and even try to replicate its key ideas in code.\nTrack 3: The ML System Design Blueprint (Bi-weekly)This is where we connect theory to production. Every two weeks, we'll tackle a classic ML system design prompt, like \u0026quot;Design a News Feed Ranker,\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Design YouTube Recommendations,\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;Design a system for detecting hate speech.\u0026quot; We'll whiteboard the architecture, discuss trade-offs, and detail everything from data ingestion to model serving and monitoring.\nTrack 4: The Foundations of Scale (Bi-weekly)An ML system is still a system. This track runs parallel to the one above but focuses on general, non-ML system design. We'll tackle problems like \u0026quot;Design a URL Shortener\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;Design a Distributed Message Queue.\u0026quot; This builds the foundational software engineering muscle needed to operate at scale.\nTrack 5: The Builder's Log (As it happens)This is my freestyle track. Whenever I learn something new, build a small side project, or have a thought on the industry, I'll post it here. It's for the joy of building and the spirit of continuous learning.\nLet's Build Together\nThis roadmap is ambitious, but the journey to becoming a top-tier ML engineer is supposed to be. I'm putting this out there not as an expert who has all the answers, but as a fellow builder on the path, documenting the climb.\nI invite you to follow along. Challenge my solutions. Suggest papers to review or design problems to tackle in the comments. Let's turn this solitary study grind into a collaborative workshop.\nReady to get started? The first workout from the Practice Loop drops next Sunday (06/29/2025).\nLet's do this.\n","link":"https://stp8954.github.io/post/introduction/","section":"post","tags":["ML","AI","ML Engineering","Interview Preparation"],"title":"Introduction"},{"body":"","link":"https://stp8954.github.io/tags/ml/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"ML"},{"body":"","link":"https://stp8954.github.io/tags/ml-engineering/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"ML Engineering"},{"body":"","link":"https://stp8954.github.io/categories/ml-engineering/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"ML Engineering"},{"body":"","link":"https://stp8954.github.io/post/","section":"post","tags":["index"],"title":"Posts"},{"body":"","link":"https://stp8954.github.io/series/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Series"},{"body":"","link":"https://stp8954.github.io/tags/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tags"},{"body":"TODO// ADD about description\n","link":"https://stp8954.github.io/about/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"About"},{"body":"","link":"https://stp8954.github.io/archives/","section":"","tags":null,"title":""},{"body":"","link":"https://stp8954.github.io/tags/index/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"index"}]
