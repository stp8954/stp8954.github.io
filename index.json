Read more about usePageBundles.\nWith page bundles, resources for a page or section, like images or attached files, live in the same directory as the content itself rather than in your static directory.\nHugo Clarity supports the use of leaf bundles, which are any directories within the content directory that contain an index.md file. Hugo's documentation gives this example:\n1content 2├── about 3│ ├── index.md 4├── posts 5│ ├── my-post 6│ │ ├── content1.md 7│ │ ├── content2.md 8│ │ ├── image1.jpg 9│ │ ├── image2.png 10│ │ └── index.md 11│ └── my-other-post 12│ └── index.md 13│ 14└── another-section 15 ├── .. 16 └── not-a-leaf-bundle 17 ├── .. 18 └── another-leaf-bundle 19 └── index.md In the above example `content` directory, there are four leaf bundles: about: This leaf bundle is at the root level (directly under content directory) and has only the index.md.\nmy-post: This leaf bundle has the index.md, two other content Markdown files and two image files. image1 is a page resource of my-post and only available in my-post/index.md resources. image2 is a page resource of my-post and only available in my-post/index.md resources.\nmy-other-post: This leaf bundle has only the index.md.\nanother-leaf-bundle: This leaf bundle is nested under couple of directories. This bundle also has only the index.md.\nThe hierarchy depth at which a leaf bundle is created does not matter, as long as it is not inside another leaf bundle.\nAdvantages to using page bundles The image below is part of the bundle of this page, and is located at content/post/bundle/building.png. Because it's within this page's bundle, the markup for the image only has to specify the image's filename, building.png.\nIf you ever change the name of the directory in which this Markdown file and the image reside, the reference to the image would not need to be updated.\nIn addition to more cleanly organizing your content and related assets, when using page bundles, Hugo Clarity will automatically generate markup for modern image formats, which are smaller in file size.\nFor instance, when you reference an image like building.png, Hugo Clarity will check to see if the same image (based on filename) exists in WebP, AVIF or JXL formats. If you inspect the image above, you'll see a \u0026lt;source\u0026gt; element for building.webp, because that file is also present. Hugo Clarity will only include the markup if these images exist.\nBrowsers that support these formats and the \u0026lt;picture\u0026gt; element will load them, while browsers that do not will fall-back to the default image. Read more about this process.\nFinally, note that page assets can be further managed and refined within the page's front matter if you wish, and are not limited to images alone.\nDisadvantages to using page bundles Page resources in a bundle are only available to the page with which they are bundled — that means you can't include an image with one page and then reference it from another.\nImages that are being used in multiple places are more appropriate for your Hugo assets directory. Unlike files in the Hugo static directory, files in the assets directory can be run through Hugo Pipes, which includes image processing.\n","link":"https://example.com/post/bundle/","section":"post","tags":["Hugo"],"title":"Using Hugo page bundles"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/archives/","section":"","tags":null,"title":""},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/css/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"css"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/featured/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"featured"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/html/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"html"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/markdown/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"markdown"},{"body":"This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Hugo content files, also it shows whether basic HTML elements are decorated with CSS in a Hugo theme.\nHeadings The following HTML \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;—\u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; elements represent six levels of section headings. \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; is the highest section level while \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; is the lowest.\nH1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 Paragraph Xerum, quo qui aut unt expliquam qui dolut labo.

Because it has alt text but no title text, the caption is generated by the alt text.\nRemote image, specified caption The following image is loaded from a remote URL. The alt text is the same (for screen readers and in cases when the image doesn't load) but because a separate title is provided, the title is used for the caption:\nThis is Jane Doe Image with alt text and no caption Alt text is always recommended for SEO, accessibility and in cases when images don't load. However, you don't necessarily always want an image to have a caption. In that case, use a title with one space:\nBlockquotes The blockquote element represents content that is quoted from another source, optionally with a citation which must be within a footer or cite element, and optionally with in-line changes such as annotations and abbreviations.\nBlockquote without attribution Tiam, ad mint andaepu dandae nostion secatur sequo quae. Note that you can use Markdown syntax within a blockquote.\nBlockquote with attribution Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.\n— Rob Pike1\nTables Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but Hugo supports supports them out-of-the-box.\nName Age Bob 27 Alice 23 Inline Markdown within tables Italics Bold Code italics bold code Code Blocks Code block with backticks 1\u0026lt;!doctype html\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 3\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Example HTML5 Document\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; 6\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; 7\u0026lt;body\u0026gt; 8 \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Test\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; 9\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; 10\u0026lt;!-- this line is extraneous 2Error from server (Forbidden): deployments.apps is forbidden: User \u0026#34;chiptest\u0026#34; cannot create resource \u0026#34;deployments\u0026#34; in API group \u0026#34;apps\u0026#34; in the namespace \u0026#34;default\u0026#34; --\u0026gt; 11\u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Code block indented with four spaces \u0026lt;!doctype html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026quot;en\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026quot;utf-8\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Example HTML5 Document\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Test\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Code block with Hugo's internal highlight shortcode 1\u0026lt;!doctype html\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 3\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Example HTML5 Document\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; 6\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; 7\u0026lt;body\u0026gt; 8 \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Test\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; 9\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; 10\u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; List Types Ordered List First item Second item Third item Unordered List List item Another item And another item Nested list Fruit Apple Orange Banana Dairy Milk Cheese Other Elements — abbr, sub, sup, kbd, mark GIF is a bitmap image format.\nH2O\nXn + Yn = Zn\nPress CTRL+ALT+Delete to end the session.\nMost salamanders are nocturnal, and hunt for insects, worms, and other small creatures.\nThe above quote is excerpted from Rob Pike's talk during Gopherfest, November 18, 2015.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","link":"https://example.com/post/markdown-syntax/","section":"post","tags":["markdown","css","html","themes","featured"],"title":"Markdown Syntax Guide"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/themes/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"themes"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/categories/themes/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"themes"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/privacy/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"privacy"},{"body":"Hugo ships with several Built-in Shortcodes for rich content, along with a Privacy Config and a set of Simple Shortcodes that enable static and no-JS versions of various social media embeds.\nInstagram Simple Shortcode YouTube Privacy Enhanced Shortcode Twitter Simple Shortcode Owl bet you\u0026#39;ll lose this staring contest 🦉 pic.twitter.com/eJh4f2zncC\n\u0026mdash; San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance (@sandiegozoo) October 26, 2021 See documentation https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#tweet for more details\nVimeo Simple Shortcode ","link":"https://example.com/post/rich-content/","section":"post","tags":["shortcodes","privacy"],"title":"Rich Content"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/shortcodes/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"shortcodes"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/index/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"index"}]
